    image: "/images/silphium.jpg",
    content: `
Silphium was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as both medicine and spice. 
It was considered so valuable that it was depicted on coins. 

Overharvested and never cultivated, it vanished — a reminder of human overuse.

Some historians believe Silphium may have had contraceptive properties, 
which made it even more sought after. Its extinction is a symbol of how 
human desire can permanently alter biodiversity.`

    content: `
The St. Helena Olive was endemic to the island of St. Helena. 
Despite conservation efforts, propagation attempts failed. 

The death of the last tree in 2003 marked its extinction. 

This species reminds us that conservation requires foresight — 
by the time a species is reduced to a handful of individuals, 
it may already be too late.`

    content: `
The Sand Verbena thrived in fragile coastal dune ecosystems. 
Urban development destroyed much of its habitat. 

Though believed extinct, rare isolated individuals may survive. 

It is a story not just of loss, but of resilience — 
sometimes nature clings on in hidden corners, waiting for rediscovery.`

The Woolly-stalked Begonia was wiped out by extensive deforestation in India. 
Its loss symbolizes the price of unchecked logging in biodiversity hotspots. 

Although other begonia species survive, this one is gone forever, 
leaving behind only herbarium samples and faded records.`

Pennsylvania Smartweed once grew abundantly in wetlands. 
Urban expansion erased it from much of its range, though it survives in patches. 

Its regional extinction is a warning that local losses matter — 
ecosystems unravel even before global extinction is declared.`

Discovered in the 18th century, the Franklin Tree vanished from the wild by 1803. 
It survives today only in cultivation, thanks to early botanists preserving seeds. 

Every Franklin Tree now alive is descended from those few rescued individuals, 
a living example of human intervention saving a species, albeit outside its habitat.`
